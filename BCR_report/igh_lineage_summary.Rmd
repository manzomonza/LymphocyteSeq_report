```{r, include=FALSE}
filep  = lineage_df$filepath[1]
lineage = clonesum_read(filep)
```

#### Top 25 clones
```{r}
head(lineage, n = 25)
```

#### Top clone frequency

```{r}
top_freq = round(as.numeric(lineage[1,]$lineage_frequency)*100,2)
```

Top clone has `r top_freq`% frequency.


```{r, include=TRUE}
head(lineage)
list_topclone_results = topClone_analysis_lineage(lineage, i = 1, j = 5)
```

Top clone is `r list_topclone_results` and this seems incorrect
