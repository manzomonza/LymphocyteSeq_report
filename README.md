# LymphocyteSeq report
Integrate TCR and BCR sequencing reporting. Based on LymphocyteSeq R-package clone summary files of BCR or TCR sequencing will be analysed and aggregated via Rmarkdown into reports.

This repo will include all code required for: 
* RMarkdown template BCR sequencing
* RMarkdown template TCR sequencing
* R-based render script that based on the input files (e.g. IGH vs TRB) will execute BCR or TCR Rmarkdown template.
